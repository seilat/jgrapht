/**
 * Exact backtracking algorithm for the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path">Hamiltonian path problem</a> on
 * directed and undirected graphs.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm performs depth-first search over simple paths. From each candidate start vertex
 * it tries to extend the current path by an unused adjacent vertex; the first path that visits
 * every vertex exactly once is returned. If the exhaustive search proves that no such path
 * exists, a {@link HamiltonianPathSearchResult.Status#PROVEN_ABSENT} result is returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * The unbounded {@link #getPath(Graph)} entry point only returns {@code PATH_FOUND} or
 * {@code PROVEN_ABSENT}. The bounded {@link #searchWithStateLimit(Graph, long)} variant may
 * additionally return {@link HamiltonianPathSearchResult.Status#ABORTED} when the search hits
 * its state budget before completing.
 *
 * <p>
 * The endpoint-constrained variants {@link #getPathFrom(Graph, Object)},
 * {@link #getPathTo(Graph, Object)} and {@link #getPathBetween(Graph, Object, Object)} restrict
 * the search to Hamiltonian paths that begin at a given vertex, end at a given vertex, or run
 * between a given pair of vertices respectively. They use the same exact search and report
 * {@code PROVEN_ABSENT} when no path satisfying the endpoint constraints exists. Bounded
 * counterparts ({@link #searchWithStateLimit(Graph, long)} and
 * {@link #searchWithStateLimitBetween(Graph, Object, Object, long)}) additionally report
 * {@link HamiltonianPathSearchResult.Status#ABORTED} when a state budget is exhausted.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation is a straightforward exact DFS / backtracking solver for Hamiltonian
 * path existence, using standard pruning and candidate-ordering ideas rather than reproducing
 * any single published algorithm verbatim. For background see Rubin, F., "A Search Procedure
 * for Hamilton Paths and Circuits", JACM 21(4), 1974 (backtracking search); the
 * minimum-remaining-values candidate ordering is in the spirit of Warnsdorff's rule (Warnsdorff,
 * "Des R&ouml;sselsprunges einfachste und allgemeinste L&ouml;sung", 1823) and of
 * constraint-satisfaction reachability propagation (Tsang, "Foundations of Constraint
 * Satisfaction", 1993); the structural prechecks (block / cut-vertex / bridge / SCC) are
 * well-known necessary conditions from graph theory (see Diestel, "Graph Theory", chapter 3,
 * for the underlying decompositions).
 *
 * <p>
 * The general Hamiltonian path problem is NP-complete. This implementation is exact and runs in
 * exponential time in the worst case, so callers should expect it to be suitable for relatively
 * small graphs (the practical limit depends heavily on graph structure: sparse and highly
 * constrained graphs are typically tractable for much larger {@code n} than dense random
 * graphs).
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation applies the following correctness-preserving prechecks and search
 * heuristics, none of which can cause a false negative:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the graph contains exactly one vertex, the singleton path is returned.</li>
 * <li>If an undirected graph is not connected, no Hamiltonian path can exist, so a
 * {@link HamiltonianPathSearchResult.Status#PROVEN_ABSENT} result is returned without DFS
 * search.</li>
 * <li>If an undirected graph has more than two vertices of degree 1, no Hamiltonian path can
 * exist (a Hamiltonian path has at most two endpoints, and any degree-1 vertex must be one of
 * them).</li>
 * <li>For undirected graphs, every cut vertex (articulation point) must belong to at most two
 * biconnected blocks. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex once with at most two path-edges
 * incident to it, so it cannot enter more than two blocks meeting at a single cut vertex.</li>
 * <li>For undirected graphs, the bridge tree (whose nodes are the 2-edge-connected components
 * and whose edges are the original graph's bridges) must itself be a path. Equivalently, no
 * 2-edge-connected component may have more than two incident bridges, since a Hamiltonian
 * path enters and leaves each such component at most once.</li>
 * <li>For directed graphs, the strongly connected component condensation must itself admit a
 * Hamiltonian path. Any Hamiltonian path in the original directed graph projects to one on the
 * condensation DAG; when that condensation has no Hamiltonian path, the original graph cannot
 * either.</li>
 * <li>At every search step the current endpoint must be able to reach every still-unvisited
 * vertex through unvisited intermediaries. Otherwise the branch is pruned.</li>
 * <li>Candidate next vertices are tried in ascending order of their remaining (unvisited)
 * onward degree. This is a minimum-remaining-values style heuristic: vertices with few onward
 * options tend to fail or commit early, which generally reduces search.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Empty graphs are rejected with an {@link IllegalArgumentException}, matching the convention
 * used by other Hamiltonian / TSP solvers in JGraphT (for example
 * {@link org.jgrapht.alg.tour.HeldKarpTSP}). Graphs with self-loops are accepted but self-loops
 * are ignored, since they cannot be part of a simple path. In multigraphs, parallel edges
 * between the same pair of vertices collapse into a single DFS branch and the returned path
 * picks an arbitrary representative edge via {@link Graph#getEdge}; the result is not
 * weight-optimised across parallel edges.
 *
 * <p>
 * The returned {@link GraphPath} is a {@link GraphWalk} whose vertex list contains every vertex
 * of the graph exactly once, whose consecutive vertices are connected by an edge of the graph
 * (respecting direction in directed graphs), and whose weight is the sum of the chosen edges'
 * weights according to {@link Graph#getEdgeWeight(Object)}.
